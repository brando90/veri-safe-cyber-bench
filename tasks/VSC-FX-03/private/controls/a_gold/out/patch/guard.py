"""Filesystem access helpers with a built-in safety net.

Every read, write and directory listing done on behalf of a user goes through
this module. The functions re-check the real location of the path against the
user's folder and stop the program with exit code 86 if it lies outside. The
command layer is expected to have rejected such requests long before this
point, so the check should never fire in a correct build.
